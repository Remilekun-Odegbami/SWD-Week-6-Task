# **Final Frontend Note App**

##### **BACKGROUND**

We started front-end with HTML and CSS. With these tools we were able to build a profile website and I hope you were all able to build something that will display your work. We also looked at some free platforms where we can host our website, and then we dived into JavaScript, where we learned how to build interactive elements on our websites and used event listeners to get input values. We practised this by building a shopping list app.

For Faster and more rapid app development, we had to learn learned React. React helped us write HTML and JS code together with ease. It comes with multiple libraries that makes code easier to execute. We learned about components, functions and classes. We learned how to build an interactive form with multiple components using props and state. We practiced with our calculator APP, keyboard APP and what every software developer has to build. We added APIs to help us use dummy data and store data from our websites.

Thereâ€™s more that weâ€™ve learned and this is only a summary. To encourage you to try and remember what youâ€™ve learned and if youâ€™ve understood with little to do, this weekâ€™s task is to build a course summary.

##### **\*REQUIREMENTS\***

**Type:** Your App should consist of Register page, Login page, and Notes page.

-   Users can create a new account on your register page

-   Users who previously had an account can login to their account

-   Only logged in users can view class notes on the Notes page.

-   Users can see all class notes.

-   When a note is clicked, the note is opened to a different page where we can view everything about that note

**Concept:** Add comments of some tricks you learned from class, for example if you use state, you explain what state does or if you use map () you explain what map() does. Just a few from what you choose to do

**Styling:** Style your APP well. Play around with vanilla CSS or any library to make it look different and good.

**\*DONT'S !!!\***

Whole app copying: Itâ€™s good to learn from others and search for ways to execute things, but to make sure you understand the concepts here, donâ€™t copy the whole code. Only the small parts that you searched, but also retype them to get used to the code

_Have fun with this one_ ðŸ˜Š
